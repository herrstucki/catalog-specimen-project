# Catalog Project Specimen

A port of Catalog v1's Project Specimen to Catalog v2. Quite unpolished.

## Usage

`make build` generates a `ProjectSpecimen.js` file which you can use with Catalog. Make sure to also include [JSZip](http://stuk.github.io/jszip/) separately, as it couldn't be bundled.

```html
<script src="catalog.min.js"></script>
<script src="jszip.js"></script>
<script src="ProjectSpecimen.js"></script>
```
